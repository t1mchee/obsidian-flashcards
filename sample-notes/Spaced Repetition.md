# Spaced Repetition

Spaced repetition is a learning technique that incorporates increasing intervals of time between subsequent review of previously learned material.

## How It Works

The technique is based on the forgetting curve, which shows how information is lost over time when there is no attempt to retain it.

## Benefits

- **Improved Retention**: Better long-term memory formation
- **Efficient Learning**: Optimizes study time
- **Adaptive Scheduling**: Adjusts to individual performance

## Algorithms

### SM-2 Algorithm
The SuperMemo 2 algorithm is one of the most popular spaced repetition algorithms.

Key features:
- Interval calculation based on performance
- Ease factor adjustment
- Quality-based scheduling

### Anki's Algorithm
Anki uses a modified version of SM-2 with additional features like:
- Graduating interval
- Easy interval
- Minimum interval settings

## Implementation Tips

1. Start with short intervals for new material
2. Increase intervals for well-known content
3. Reset intervals for forgotten material
4. Track performance metrics
