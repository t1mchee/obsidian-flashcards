# Test List Rendering

This note tests bulleted list support:

- First item in the list
- Second item with **bold text**
- Third item with *italic text*
- Fourth item with inline math: $E = mc^2$

Some text after the list.

Another list:

* Alternative bullet style
* Works with asterisks too
* Multiple items

Nested concepts:

- Main concept 1
- Main concept 2
- Main concept 3

Math and lists together:

- The variance is $\sigma^2$
- The mean is $\mu$
- The standard deviation is $\sigma$

Display math after list:

$$
f(x) = \frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}}e^{-\frac{(x-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}}
$$
