This note demonstrates the new Obsidian features.

>[!info] Information
>This is an info callout. It provides additional context about the topic.

## Important Concepts

>[!warning] Warning
>Pay attention to this important detail!

>[!tip] Pro Tip
>Here's a helpful tip for understanding this concept.

## Mathematical Examples

The mean is defined as:

$$\mu = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i$$

>[!example] Example
>Let's consider a simple example where $n = 5$ and the values are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
>Then the mean is $\mu = 3$.

>[!question] Question
>Can you calculate the variance?

>[!success] Solution
>The variance is:
>$$\sigma^2 = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i - \mu)^2 = 2$$
