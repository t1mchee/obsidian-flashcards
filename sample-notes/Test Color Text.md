# Test Color Text

This note tests the Fast Color Text plugin.

## Colored References

The ==(red)Estimator of tomorrow value conditional upon today is today value==

Some more examples:
- ==(blue)This text is blue==
- ==(green)This text is green==
- ==(yellow)This text is yellow==
- ==(purple)This text is purple==
- ==(orange)This text is orange==

You can also use ==(#ff0000)custom hex colors==

## Mathematical Definitions

The conditional expectation is:
$$E[Y_{t+1} | Y_t] = Y_t$$

This is a ==(red)fundamental property== of the martingale process.
